# Block Hammer

## Introduction
This mod is an attempt to reduce the need for inventory space.

## Features
### changes to stairs, slabs, fences, fence gates, walls, panes, (stripped) wood/hyphae
- are no longer craftable
- drop only the "full" block

### 4 new items (block hammer) which change blocks on use
- 1: change "full blocks" to "part blocks"
    - eg. glass block to glass pane and glass pane to glass block
- 2: change shape when applicable
    - eg. slabs to top or double slabs
- 3: change axis when applicable
    - eg. logs, chains, etc.
- 4: change orientation when applicable
    - eg. facing of stairs, furnaces, etc.
    
## TODO / Ideas for features
- merge the 4 hammer items into one with different modes
- change shape to not update when neighboring blocks are changed
- new block shapes such as vertical slabs
- save a configuration and apply it to newly placed blocks
- maybe make it data-driven
